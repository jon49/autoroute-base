# Auto-route Base

## Summary

`Auto-route base` is a skeleton for creating custom auto routing capabilities.

## Installation

Install with `npm`:

```

## Example

See the test for a simple example.

I will be creating a specific implementation of auto-route base which will be
used as an example later on (hopefully tomorrow?).
